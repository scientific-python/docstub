# docstub pre-release 0.7.0rc0

Notes for the pre-release of docstub 0.7.0rc0 on 2026-01-19.

## Enhancement

- Add support for callable expressions like `Callable[[int, str], int]` in doctypes ([#123](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/123)).
- Ensure that sources (file paths and line numbers) in command line output are sorted "naturally". For example `foo.py:9` should go before `foo.py:24` ([#119](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/119)).
- Log warnings emitted while parsing docstrings with NumPyDoc and link to the file and line number of the docstring ([#55](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/55)).

## Performance

- Avoid overusing libcst's "slower" `findall` ([#121](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/121)).

## Bug Fixes

- Add support for expressions like `Literal[1, "some string"]` in doctypes. The grammar previously only allowed names inside this form ([#55](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/55)).

## Documentation

- Add contribution, release and style guides ([#103](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/103)).
- Update README after merging contributing guide ([#120](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/120)).

## DevOps

- Bump actions/checkout from 5 to 6 in the actions group ([#117](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/117)).

## Maintenance

- Uncouple doctype transformation from name resolution ([#55](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/55)).
