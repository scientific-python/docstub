# docstub 0.3.0

This release marks the first "Alpha" release of docstub. ðŸŽ‰

## Highlights

- **A revamped command line interface**
  Stubs are created with the new subcommand `docstub run` which leaves room to add other subcommands in the future ([#49](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/49)).
  The new subcommand also includes two new options `--group-errors` ([#30](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/30)) and `--allow-errors` to help with adopting docstub gradually ([#32](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/32)).

- **Improved error reporting and statistics**
  When docstub encounters errors in the package it is running on it will now point at the file and line where they are originating from ([#10](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/10)).
  Similarly, docstub will report the total number of errors, types that it didn't know where to import from and the total runtime.

- **Improved typing support**
  Module and class attributes can now be typed in docstrings too ([#18](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/18)).
  This includes support for the special case of dataclasses ([#26](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/26)).
  You can now document generator functions with the "Yields" and "Receives" docstring sections ([#29](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/29)).
  For edge cases, that docstub doesn't yet (correctly) support, you can now wrap lines in `# docstub: off` and `# docstub: on`.
  This selectively prevents docstub from changing lines during stub creation ([#25](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/25)).

- **Improved configuration**
  Simplified the configuration file.
  Declaring external types should be a lot more straightforward.
  A reference for the configuration file is scheduled for the next release ([#45](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/45)).

- We added a **user guide** to get started with using docstub as well as a **reference** for the extended typing syntax that can be used in docstrings ([#24](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/24)).

## Enhancement

- Stub files are now created inplace if no explicit output directory is specified.
  Pre-existing stub files that are not managed by docstub are preserved as before ([#28](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/28)).
- You can now indicate a plural with `(s)` in expressions like `list of int(s)`  ([#37](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/37)).
  The grammar supporting the typing syntax in docstring should be better behaved for edge cases now.
- Collect docnames of analyzed source in advance ([#2](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/2)).
- Point to precise line in parsed source for parsing problems ([#10](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/10)).
- Support attributes and type aliases ([#18](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/18)).
- Add direct support for dataclasses ([#26](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/26)).
- Support Yields section and Generator functions ([#29](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/29)).
- Add `--group-errors` option ([#30](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/30)).
- Add `--allow-errors` command line option ([#32](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/32)).
- Support combined NumPyDoc params ([#41](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/41)).

## Bug Fixes

- Only use `| None` for optional parameters if appropriate ([#14](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/14)).
- Check test suite with mypy ([#27](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/27)).
- fix check for length 1 literal ([#40](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/40)).
- Allow signed numbers in literals ([#46](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/46)).

## Performance

- Types collected while creating stubs for a package are now cached so that the next run is a lot faster ([#15](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/15)).

## Documentation

- Attribute copyright to Scientific Python Developers ([#4](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/4)).
- Reword descriptions in manual ([#23](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/23)).
- Refactor and document doctype grammar ([#33](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/33)).
- Add minimal documentation ([#24](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/24)).

## Devops

- Add basic CI configuration ([#8](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/8)).
- Enable doctests by default ([#12](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/12)).

- Check test suite with mypy ([#27](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/27)).
- Check `tests/` with basedpyright in CI in "standard" mode ([#50](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/50)).
- Prepare release of version 0.3.0 ([#51](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/51)).
