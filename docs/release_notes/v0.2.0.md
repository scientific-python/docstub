# docstub 0.2.0

A first prototype of the tool with the following features:

- Given a source directory `examples/example_pkg`, create a stub files for
  every contained Python file in `examples/example-stubs/`
- No need to import the source package!
- PYI files that already exist in the source package take precedence and are
  copied directly
- Type description in NumPy style docstrings are parsed and transformed into
  Python ready type annotations
  - supports `tuple of float` like syntax
  - supports array syntax like: `(N,) uint8 array-like` or
    `array of dtype float and shape (10, ..., 3)` (shape is discarded for now)
  - supports literals like `{"reflect", "mirror", "constant"}`
  - supports `<some type>, optional, extra information`
  - see included `examples/` for more...
- `Any` is used wherever types are missing, except for the first parameter of
  methods and classmethods
- Specify how used types can be imported via a map in
  `docstub.toml::[tool.docstub.docnames]`. Imports using `from` and `as` are
  supported. This map can also serve to provide synonyms.
- Created stub files are automatically formatted with isort and black, if these
  optional dependencies are available.
