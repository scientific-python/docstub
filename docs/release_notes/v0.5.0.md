# docstub 0.5.0

We're happy to announce the feature release of docstub 0.5.0 on 2025-10-25!
This release supports Python 3.12 to 3.14.


## Enhancement

- **Improve output and error reporting.** All output of docstub is now controllable with the existing `--verbose` option and the new `--quiet` option. Also indicate the (severity) level of output with a single char, e.g. "I" for information or "W" for warnings ([#79](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/79)).
- **Automatically add a `py.typed` file** alongside generated stubs. This ensures that type checkers can make use of the stubs ([#98](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/98)).
- Include stubs for docstub in the distribution packages ([#96](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/96)).

## Deprecations

- Remove array expressions inspired by scikit-image. This impacts forms like `(M, 3) int array`. Instead, prefer the more expressive convention used by scikit-learn, for example, `array of dtype int and shape (M, 3)` ([#77](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/77)).

## Bug Fixes

- Ensure glob patterns to ignore files work with relative paths. Previously, if docstub was invoked on a relative path, no files would be ignored ([#78](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/78)).
- Avoid infinite loop in module_name_from_path ([#89](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/89)).

## Documentation

- **Setup HTML documentation** on Read the Docs ([#84](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/84)).
- Update documentation and add a glossary with a few central terms ([#84](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/84)).
- Add a dedicated installation guide to the documentation ([#97](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/97)).
- Add a short section on "Distributing stubs files" to the introduction guide. This also describes docstubs behavior  regarding `py.typed` files ([#98](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/98)).
- Improve introduction statement in introduction guide ([#100](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/100)).

## DevOps

- Add (some) suggestions from repo-review ([#81](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/81)).
- Bump actions/checkout from 4 to 5 in the actions group ([#82](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/82)).
- Use `macos-latest` runner ([#85](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/85)).
- Bump actions/setup-python and pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish ([#86](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/86)).
- Add zizmor as pre-commit hook ([#87](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/87)).
- Add 14 days cooldown period to dependabot ([#88](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/88)).
- Test on Python 3.14 ([#90](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/90)).
- Explicitly place Read the Docs ethical ads ([#92](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/92)).
- Pad ethical ad from Read the Docs ([#93](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/93)).
- Add the version string to the sidebar in the HTML docs ([#95](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/95)).
- Prevent `.github/scripts/assert-unchanged.sh` from exiting early ([#98](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/98)).

## Maintenance

- Use dependency-groups for development dependencies ([#83](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/83)).
- Refactor reporting to use Python's native logging implementation ([#79](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/79)).
- Link to introduction on RTD in README ([#94](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/94)).
