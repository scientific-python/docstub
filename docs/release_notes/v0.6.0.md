# docstub v0.6.0

We're happy to announce the release of docstub v0.6.0 on 2025-11-04!

## Enhancement

- Add the new experimental `--workers` option to `docstub run` to **generate stub files in parallel**. This can reduce runtime significantly for projects with many files. For now, multiprocessing has to be explicitly enabled by requesting a number of workers ([#110](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/110)).
- **Highlight help messages** (invoked with `-h` or `--help`) of the command line interface with colors and reformat. This should improve the readability ([#109](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/109)).
- Don't color output if the environment variable `NO_COLOR=1` is set ([#109](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/109)).
- Support using types from the standard library module `types` directly without requiring configuration or imports for them ([#106](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/106)).
- Provide file and line context in warnings that are emitted while parsing doctypes ([#108](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/108)).
- Add the short command line option `-g` as an alternative to `docstub run --group-errors` ([#109](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/109)).
- Hide additional debug information behind "verbosity 3" (`-vvv`). This makes the option `-vv` a bit more usable.  Also use a  more generally visible ANSI color for debug  information (bright_black) ([#104](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/104)).

## Performance

- Speed-up how fast docstub's command line displays help text with  the `-h` or `--help` option ([#112](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/112)).

## Bug Fixes

- Ensure that warnings are raised for partially documented signatures. Previously, no warning was raised for untyped parameters when at least one parameter was annotated ([#107](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/107)).
- Ensure that docstub still returns a non-zero exit code when it is run with output completely disabled (`-qq`). The same applies when running docstub with  `--quiet --fail-on-warnings` ([#110](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/110)).
- Ensure that warnings are raised for undocumented parameters and attributes. Previously, no warning was raised for parameters and attributes when at least that were mentioned in a docstring, but didn't have a doctype ([#111](https://github.com/scientific-python/docstub/pull/111)).
