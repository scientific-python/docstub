# Design and style guide

## Goals

- Docstub facilitates gradual and easy adoption.
- Docstub aims for readable type descriptions in docstrings.
  Extended doctype syntax should improve readability and work with existing conventions.
- Docstub encourages fallback mechanisms like inline annotations, or creating a stub file manually.
  This helps with cases that would have a poor readability in docstrings, would be very complex, or are not supported.
- Docstub is not a type checker.
- Docstub is not a linter.

The development is, in part, motivated by an effort to add type annotations to the [scikit-image project](https://scikit-image.org).
This may inform some short-term priorities and the roadmap.

That said, docstub is a project for the community and welcomes ideas, feedback, and contributions in any form!
