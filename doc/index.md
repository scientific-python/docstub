docstub's documentation
=======================

**Date**: |today|, **Version**: |version|

Welcome! `docstub` is a command-line tool to generate `Python`_ stub files
(i.e., PYI files) from type descriptions found in `numpydoc`_ style docstrings.

`numpy`_, `scipy`_, and the scikits follow a common convention for docstrings
that provides for consistency, while also allowing toolchains such as
`numpydoc`_ to produce well-formatted reference guides.

Our project follows the `SciPy code of conduct`_.
